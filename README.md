# Covid-19-Analysis
🚀 Project Alert: COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (India Focused)
📊 Understanding Data Behind the Pandemic

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on a data-driven project that explores the trends, correlations, and insights hidden in the COVID-19 dataset provided by Our World in Data. This EDA focuses specifically on India 🇮🇳 and aims to analyze how various factors evolved over time.

🔍 Key Insights Uncovered:
📈 Growth patterns in new and total COVID-19 cases
💉 Vaccination rollout trends and coverage rates
⚰️ Case Fatality Rate (CFR) evolution
🧪 Testing and positivity rate analysis
📊 Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables like new cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination

🔧 Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Sample Visualizations:
Line plots of daily new cases and deaths (smoothed)

Vaccination trends vs case reduction

Correlation heatmap showing relationships like:

More vaccinations ↔️ lower death rates

More testing ↔️ better detection and control
